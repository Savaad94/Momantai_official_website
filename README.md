# Momantai_official_website
A complete website for Momantai, a fictional Cantonese restaurant, developed for a Higher Vocational Training course. The project uses HTML and CSS to build a clean, responsive layout with sections for home, menu, about us, and contactâ€”simulating the digital presence of a modern restaurant.
